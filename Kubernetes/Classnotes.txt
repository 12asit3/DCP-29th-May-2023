		Installation and config. of Kubernetes.
		
			kubectl		- cli  
			
			pods		- Smallest unit to task schedul	
			
			
		Using Kubeadm - we can install and config kubernetes master and cluster.	
			
			
		Pre-Requisites :::
		
			1. 2 or more CPUs
			2. 3GB or more RAM
			3. Full network access among the nodes.
			4. Enable SWAPOFF 
			5. Disable Selinux
			
		
		Kubernetes Concepts ::::
		
			kubectl 			- Command Line Utility.
			pods 
			Controller Objects 
				Replication Controller 
				Replicasets
				Deployment Controller 
				Daemonset
			Services
				NodePort 
				ClusterIP
				Load Balancer
			Persistant Volumes
			Persistant Volume Claim
			HELM - Package Manager 
			
			
		Pod -- created ===> one copy of pod, running in one WN.
			
				Replication Controller 
				Replicasets			
			
					- Are used to create replicas of Pods. 
					- Scale up / down 
					
					Labels & Selectors == are used to identify the template.
					
					
		Both Replication Controller and Replicasets 
					- Both RC / RS are used to run a specific no. of pods in the cluster.
					- Are used to create replicas of Pods. 
					- Scale up / down 
					- RC uses Equality based operator 	app=nginx-app => envi=dev
					- RS used set based operator 		{envi:[dev,qa,uat]}
					- Scale Up / Down
					- kubectl scale rc nginx-rc --replicas=5
					- kubectl scale rs nginx-rs --replicas=5
					
		
					
			
			
		Daemonset	:::

					- Is used to run a copy of pod in all the available/set of workernodes
					- Automatically create the pod in all the new nodes.

				Monitoring tool -> 
					
		ConfigMaps 	--> are used to send some non-sensitive data to pod 
		
		Secrets	 	--> are used to send sensitive data to pod
